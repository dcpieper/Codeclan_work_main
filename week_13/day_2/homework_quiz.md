1. Polymorphism comes from the greek words "poly" meaning many, and "morph" meaning change. So polymorphism means that something can have many forms.
2. It means the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways. It enables objects to have multiple forms, so they can respond differently based on context. For example, a pizza eating app. Each pizza will have unique properties or methods, toppings, calories, but also share common methods, such as eat, reheat, which can be called on any pizza type.
3. Inheritance or interfaces
4. As many as there are classes
5. a game with different enemies e.g orc, goblin, dragon. Create an enemy superclass and have a subclass for each type. Each enemy would have its own specific behaviour and attributes, but they would also have shared methods that they inherit from the enemy superclass e.g takeDamage, die.
6. Composition involves creating an object that contains other objects as its instance variables, which are used to provide some of the behaviour of the containing object.
7. Use it when you need to create comlex objects with specific behaviours that cannot be easily acheived by inheritance alone. E.g car simulation, Car object containing car part objects like Engine, Transmission, Tyres etc.
8. With composition, the contained objects are isolated to inside the containing object. When the containing object is deleted, the contained objects are also. In aggregation, the contained objects can exist outside the containing object, and can be used in other containing objects and aren't deleted along with the containing object.
9. Allows greater flexibility, can change behaviour by changing components rather than changing inheritance.
10. Destroyed.
11. Nothing
